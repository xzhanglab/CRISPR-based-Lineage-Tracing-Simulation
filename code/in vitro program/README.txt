1. Please put all code files in the same folder to run the program.
2. All the 76 data files can be grouped into another folder.
3. In the functions readtree.m, readtreeNBJ.m, readtreeNBJ_NF.m, and readtreeRMP_NF.m, please set the correct directory to the 76 data files.
4. MC_invitro.m is the main function.
5. The program outputs are sorted as follows - 

Column 1 - mean accuracy using RMP
Column 2 - max accuracy using RMP
Column 3 - mean accuracy using non-filtering RMP
Column 4 - max accuracy using non-filtering RMP
Column 5 - mean accuracy using NBJ
Column 6 - max accuracy using NBJ
Column 7 - mean accuracy using non-filtering NBJ
Column 8 - max accuracy using non-filtering NBJ
Column 9 - leaf node count for each tree
